      <article>
        <div class="flex-child">
          <p>Hello! My name is Pica Nievas and I am from Austin Texas. I enjoy
            playing board games, making cakes and being with my family. Some of the
            board games that I like to play are on the longer side usually more than
            two hours long. My favorite board game right now is probably Wonderland
            Wars, the theme of the game being Alice in Wonderland. Playing board
            games with my family is also a great time to gather together witch is something thing that I love to do. I
            also
            love to make
            cakes. I have run my own cake decorating business from my home for 8
            years. My favorite types of cakes to make are wedding cakes. I love how
            big and dramatic they are. I really like to design with the fresh flowers included in
            my cakes so that is always a little different and beautiful.

            <p>Texas is one of the largest states in the US. Austin is the capitol and
              is also known as the live music capitol. Some people might think of
              Texas as a dusty desert landscape and while those areas are part of
              Texas, Austin is an oasis of green trees, rivers and lakes.
